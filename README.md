Kick
====

The intent of this project is to interface with PostgreSQL by exploring [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) data.

There are examples for:

- [Starting/Stopping PostgreSQL](src/sh/control_postgres.sh)
- [Downloading Kickstarter](src/python/01_download.py)
- [`psycopg2` for interfacing with PostgreSQL](src/python/custom.py)
- [Calculating document similarity](src/python/sim_doc.py)

There is also explorative work in the ipython notebooks located in [src/ipynb](src/ipynb)
